- THIS GITHUB ONLY CONTAINS FILES FOR THE WIKI (NOT) FOR THE GAME

## What's This
This is where i put all of my assets for the new wiki for mini-empires RTS on roblox these assets are mostly provided by me since i'm doing most of the work on the wiki to make it look nice the community can also help with these icons and make them to post them on here.
## How can i make icons
In order to make icons i use PHOTOSHOP but you can also use photopea just insert the source files that are in src/photoshop and the names should be relative to the pictures
The icons are easy to configure as they are already done for you just insert assets from other assets and combine them with the main icon your making
## How can i add these icons into the github
To add these icons to the actual github go to Pull Requests at the top Click on New pull request and insert your files, they will be approved by me or the other admins!
